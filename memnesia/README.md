# memnesia: MPI Memory Consumption Utilities

## NOTE TO USERS
**Currently, memnesia is missing many MPI wrappers, so unless your application
uses only a subset of the calls found in trace/memnesia-pmpi.cc, then statistics
generated by memnesia will be inaccurate.**

## Build
```
cd build &&  CC=mpicc CXX=mpic++ cmake .. && make -j2 && cd -
```

## Run
